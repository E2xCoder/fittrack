-- Supabase exposes every table in the public schema through its REST/GraphQL Data
-- API to the `anon` and `authenticated` roles. FitTrack never uses that API (all
-- access goes through Prisma as the `postgres` role, which bypasses RLS), so the
-- tables are locked down: RLS on, no policies, no grants for the API roles.
-- Idempotent, and a no-op for the role statements on databases without those roles.
